      Its is being developed by the Computational Radiology Group at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg, Germany, <br/>
      in collaboration with the Research Group for Perioperative Vascular Biology at the Clinic for Anaesthesiology <br/>
      at the University Hospital Heidelberg and the Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (IKIM) at the University Hospital Essen. <br/>
      <br/>
      The current models are based on the following two U-Net-based segmentation pipelines: <br/>
